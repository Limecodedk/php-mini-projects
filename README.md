# php-projects

These small projects are designed with the sole purpose of practicing PHP and improving my skills. They are exclusively created as training exercises, and the quality may vary as the primary focus is on learning.

I update these projects regularly to incorporate new knowledge and enhance the code. If you come across any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Thank you for stopping by, and I hope that my training projects can be helpful for others looking to enhance their skills in PHP development.
